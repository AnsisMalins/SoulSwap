My first project in Unity.

Standard mouse and WASD for movement. Press E to swap control (your soul) between your box and an AI controlled box.

The soul swap mechanic is implemented in the Creature class. RobotSoul and Util are also interesting to look at.

The total time I've spent on this is about 40 hours over 3 weekends.
